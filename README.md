{
    message: {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: "Hello there! As an AI language model, I'm happy to chat with you. How can I assist you today?"
    },
    finish_reason: 'stop',

The response is pretty funny

```
As an AI language model, I do not have emotions. However, I'm programmed to help you with any questions or conversations you have on your mind. How can I assist you today?
